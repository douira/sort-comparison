# sort-comparison
Compares the use of insertion and internal sort for differently unsorted arrays

## Screenshot of results
The colors show which algorithm was faster. Blue is for insertion sort and green is for the internal `Array.prototype.sort`. The numbers are the measured time it took each algorithm to sort an array of a certain length and unsortedness. Unsortedness is how much (randomly) larger a number can be than its initial position in the array.
